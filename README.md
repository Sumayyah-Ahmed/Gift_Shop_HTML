# **Gift_Shop_HTML**
This is my website that I created at my first HTML & CSS class. I love coding in Notepad++ and at Adobe Dreamweaver. This website belongs to a gift shop. This Gift shop has many categories like clothes, Shoes, Books and much more. Our famous items sold often include coffee mugs, stuffed animals, toys, t-shirts, postcards, handmade collections, and other souvenirs, aimed to be kept by the buyer as a reminder of their visit, or given to another as a gift.
